# Welcome,

Denver here, Civil Engineering student who wants to make the live's of those around me easier by trying to learn **Python** and **VBA** to the best of my ability so that I can automate and simplify complex tasks. I am also working on improving my *cooking* and enjoy *pickleball* 🎾, *juggling*🤹‍♂️, and *yoga*🧘‍♂️.

One thing that I am working on improving is my personal documentation system📚 to allow me to *quickly reference* instead of *relearning everything* from scratch when problems similar to those I have already encountered come up.
