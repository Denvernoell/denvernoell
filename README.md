# Welcome,

Denver here, Civil Engineering graduate💧 who enjoys taking existing processes and improving them using **Python**🐍.

I started my coding journey by learning **VBA**📊 to help automate tedious **Excel** processes which inspired me to dive into the field and learn more.

My personal knowlege system📚 is created in **Notion** and serves as a source of documentation, project planning, and task management.

I am also working on improving my *cooking* and enjoy *pickleball* 🎾 and *yoga*🧘‍♂️.
