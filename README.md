# Welcome,

Denver here, Civil Engineering graduate💧 who enjoys taking existing processes and improving them using **Python**🐍.

I started my coding journey by learning **VBA**📊 to help automate tedious **Excel** processes which inspired me to dive into the field and learn more.

This year I am excited to create applications using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/),and [Pynecone](https://pynecone.io/) as they progress and get new features.
