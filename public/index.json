Personally, a positive impact was that this has given me more time to spend with my family that I wouldn’t have had. It forced me to slow down and focus on things to do together like cooking and watching educational videos. On the negative side, the challenge of adapting to online school and the cost of having to give up my apartment and move back home due to school being shut down.\nAnother challenge was to find new ways to study remotely with my peers. After working out the kinks, we found that this was a much more efficient way to collaborate and share our progress and ideas. Before we went to virtual learning, study groups required checking schedules, picking a location, people having to come late or leave early or not be able to come at all due to other commitments.

Going forward, even after this pandemic, I feel that study groups have a lot to learn from this experience and can cut down on wasted time such as preparation and travel time.\nIn January of 2020, I started a new internship. Little did I know that the year was going to take an unexpected turn. I was asked to learn new programs that had their own languages. The stay at home order allowed for more time to research and practice these topics which inspired me to learn more and more. I had more time to devote to reading as well as learning these and other new skills. Meetings were being held virtually just like my study groups. I can see how keeping meetings virtual in the future could be beneficial. Meetings could be recorded and played back for those that were unavailable.\nI believe that the time I have spent with programming languages in 2020 has opened my eyes to what can be accomplished through scripting and the benefits of reading and understanding documentation. Going forward, when I encounter a problem and develop a solution, I will look back at this unprecedented time and realize among the adversities, there were many benefits that will have forever shaped my future.\nOne of the things that it allowed me to do was to devote time to reading as well as learning new skills. It reduced lost time while traveling and allowed for things that were not there before.\nDuring the interview, questions about my experience with Excel came up. During my first week, one of my coworkers asked a question about a project that I had talked about in my interview. He proceeded to tell me that they sometimes used macros using VBA to do some of their work. This is the first time I had heard of VBA and throught the following weeks I started reading a book about the basics of VBA and started using it in my day-to-day work.\nA few weeks later I was having a conversation with the same coworker who was telling be about a project a few years back that had some major hurdles because of the sheer amount of data. He described the problems that he was having and explained that he ended up learning SQL because it was able to be used with the large amount of data. I thought it was crazy that he learned a programming language for one project. Little did I know that over the course of the next few months I myself would learn a few languages. Now I am willing to learn a language to accomplish one task.\nI was given a project of scanning and naming photos with the end goal being to publish them for the world to see. This process involved me diving deep into VBA to learn how to automate the naming and organizing process of the project. After the photos were scanned, I learned Powershell scripting to rearrange the photos based on a Regular Expression pattern and place them in the decades that they were originally taken in. From there I learned the basics of HTML and CSS in order to create the website. Once I created the website then I learned about web hosting and how to deploy it to a remote server which involved me learning SSH as well as other shell functions.\nFrom there I thought it would be a good Idea to learn Python as I saw its uses for school. In school I took a MatLab course where I used what I had learned in VBA and Python to help with the basic conventions and structures of the language.\nI also learned how to use AutoHotKey which is a programming language to automate tasks in Windows such as creating custom shortcuts for processes that can range in complexity from typing today\u0026rsquo;s date in a certain format to opening a set of programs and much more.\n",

    "body": "When Covid hit my city pretty hard, my company descided to switch to remote work in order to mitigate risk. In our office, employees have dual-monitor set ups. To anyone who has never had a dual or tri-monitor set up, try it, you\u0026rsquo;ll like it. Because of this, our boss reccommended getting a second monitor if we did not already have one so that we could mimic our office set up as well as possible. This caused me to scour the internet to find a monitor that was cheap but also fit my needs.\nWhat I found is that used monitors weren\u0026rsquo;t much cheaper than getting a used computer with a monitor. I found a computer with a 24\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; monitor with a small desktop. I went with that option and soon found out that the monitor wasn\u0026rsquo;t super great when it came to quality when using the VGA cable. Then when it came to reimbursement I did not get a reciept because the seller would not give one.\nI watched a video about Linux and he showed how to download Ubuntu. The phrasing that the video used was You can dual-boot if you want but I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend it and don\u0026rsquo;t know why you would want to. So I went all in and erased the Windows 10 from the device and quickly found out that the wifi that was working on Windows, was not working on Ubuntu. After watching 4 different videos showing how to use terminal commands to get access to wifi, I was not successful. This was some of my first usage with the command line.\nThen I watched a video talking about how Linux Mint is the perfect distro to start with. So I switched over to Linux mint and after being unsuccessful with the Wifi on there I figured out how to use the Ethernet cord from my primary desktop to my Linux desktop, since there were no Ethernet connections where I had my computers. I figured out some cool stuff with linux mint and within a few days ended up on Manjaro. Manjaro was cool and all but I watched a video about how to change the startup screen and the poster said that they were using Awesome because it looked cool and they changed it to Awesome, so I changed it to Awesome. Then they rebooted their computer and I rebooted my computer. When my computer rebooted, I found that I had made a mistake and was not able to log back in. Come to find out, I was using xfce and not Awesome. This is something that I did not understand at the time.\nThen I tried out POP! OS. I really liked the look and feel of POP!OS. The keyboard shortcuts were also pretty nifty. They had just come out with a window tiling feature and it exposed me to how that works. This feature also introduced me to having multiple desktops instead of just having everything open on one desktop. After some time I realized that most of the look and feel actually was from Gnome and not POP. I switched back to Manjaro but this time I used the Gnome edition.\n",

They showed that html5up.net had many templates that could be used and edited for free that actually look really cool. Going to the site I downloaded a couple of the templates and started looking at the HTML. Fun fact, I didn\u0026rsquo;t know HTML at the time. So I watched a crash course to teach me the basics of what different elements were used for and how they affected the website.\nCSS Next was CSS. I also didn\u0026rsquo;t know anything about CSS. Learning about CSS was interesting because it can be daunting if you don\u0026rsquo;t know exactly what you want it to look like.\nJavaScript After that came JavaScript. Took a look at the code for that portion. Still have no Idea what is going on with that.\nGithub Uploading it to a Github Repo did not take much effort although the process is still fairly new to me.\nThis worked for my personal site but when it came to hosting photos for the photo site, file sizes became and issue and I had to look for something that could host large files and files in large quantities\nDomain name Epik\nI personally used Epik because it was recommended by Luke Smith. This process was fairly simple and did not take a whole lot of effort. DNS records: How to point to different sites\nVPS hosting Digital Ocean This part might be the weirdest and most complex part of the whole experience. What a VPS basically does is gives you a server that you have access to that you can upload files to and host your website from them\nThis consisted of:\n Learning how to remote in to a server Sending files from your current computer to a remote server Pointing a custom domain to the hosted server site  ",

    "description": "My Steps Creating a Moment of Inertia Calculator",
    "body": "In my Design of Steel Structures course, in order to calculate needed values for beams. The Moment of Inertia, Centroid, and related properties need to be calculated. Shapes included in the AISC Steel Manual have these values calculated but if there is a member not included in the manual or if it is a built up member, then it needs to be calculated by hand.\nThis led me to find a simple example on YouTube in order to break the problem down into variables that could make it work for any situation.\nThe way it works is to enter the top left and bottom right coordinates of each individual rectangle, counting (0,0) as the bottom left of all points even if it is not part of the object. The shape class takes these and determines the area, length of each side, and the maxes and minimums.\nAll of the individual shapes are then added to the total class which determines the highest y value, which is needed for the centroid calculation. The centroid for each shape is found and then $\\overline{y} = \\frac{\\sum{\\overline{y} * A}}{\\sum{\\overline{y}}}$ is found to find the centroid of the total shape, which is used for the parallel axis theorem, the $A*d^2$ of the Moment of Inertia calculation.\nFrom there the Moment of Inertia is calculated and tabulated separately in a markdown table.\n",

    "body": "Starting my Steel class, I could tell immediately that the problems in this class had lots of opportunity to be programmed due to the reliance on code. This means that any cutting back on referring to the code book can be very beneficial.\nWhile solving problems I found that although there were many different starting conditions, most of the problems were to determine the same outputs. Because of this I created an ending function that took all of the outputs from previous functions to output the required strengths.\nThis became repetitive and my functions started having more and more inputs. One of the problems with this is if there is a new process that requires different inputs or has different outputs, there is the potential to not be compatible with later functions. This led me to learning about Object Oriented Programming.\nObject Oriented Programming allowed me to cut the amount of inputs and outputs in each function\nOne of the things that is most beneficial about this method is the implementation of the pint library. This library is used to apply units to values and is able to convert between them. This means that if an equation like the following would output 3.5 feet instead of 9. This was very helpful when the inputs could be of varying units and eliminates the need to account for unit conversions. $$3 feet + 6 inches$$\nIn order to determine the properties for a shape, the Steel Construction Manual tables needed to be checked for each shape used. I found a shapes database file on the AISC website which contained all of these values in an Excel file. This allowed me to use the pandas library to extract the needed values, and apply their units using pint syntax. This took out the potential errors that can come with pulling values from a book manually or needing to reference the same values multiple times in a single problem.\nThings I learned:\n Object Oriented Programming Module creation and upload to Pypi  ",
