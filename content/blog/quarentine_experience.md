I don’t think that many people would have guessed the amount of changes that would happen in 2020. There have been many hardships and unexpected difficulties such as job losses and businesses having to close. This has also been a time for reconnecting with loved ones and having extra time to work on projects and new interests. Personally, a positive impact was that this has given me more time to spend with my family that I wouldn’t have had. It forced me to slow down and focus on things to do together like cooking and watching educational videos. On the negative side, the challenge of adapting to online school and the cost of having to give up my apartment and move back home due to school being shut down.

Another challenge was to find new ways to study remotely with my peers. After working out the kinks, we found that this was a much more efficient way to collaborate and share our progress and ideas. Before we went to virtual learning, study groups required checking schedules, picking a location, people having to come late or leave early or not be able to come at all due to other commitments. With everyone becoming familiar with video chat and screen sharing capabilities, this allowed for us to study without actually being together with much more ease and efficiency. Going forward, even after this pandemic, I feel that study groups have a lot to learn from this experience and can cut down on wasted time such as preparation and travel time.

In January of 2020, I started a new internship. Little did I know that the year was going to take an unexpected turn. I was asked to learn new programs that had their own languages. The stay at home order allowed for more time to research and practice these topics which inspired me to learn more and more. I had more time to devote to reading as well as learning these and other new skills. Meetings were being held virtually just like my study groups. I can see how keeping meetings virtual in the future could be beneficial. Meetings could be recorded and played back for those that were unavailable.
I believe that the time I have spent with programming languages in 2020 has opened my eyes to what can be accomplished through scripting and the benefits of reading and understanding documentation. Going forward, when I encounter a problem and develop a solution, I will look back at this unprecedented time and realize among the adversities, there were many benefits that will have forever shaped my future.
