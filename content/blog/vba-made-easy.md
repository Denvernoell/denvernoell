I started a new job in 2020. Little did I know that this would spend me spiraling into learning many programming languages.

On my first day one of my co-workers asked me what extent my Excel knowledge was. I told him some of the projects that I had worked on before and he said that it was a good starting point better than some interns in the past. He followed that up by saying that they did some macros but nothing crazy. This was my first time hearing about macros and a few days later another co-worker explained to me what they were and what they could do and a few weeks later I was introduced to a project that had a lengthy macro to put the data from many workbooks and combine their data on a single workbook. By this point I had done some research into macros and editing them in the VBA editor. I made a comment about how hard it must have been and how long a process it would have been to create the macro that I had in front of me. 

After some time with this project, there were problems that arose and I ended up learning much about VBA by creating scripts to aid with the long updating process every month. There was one change that came in the data we received that made the old script almost useless and I rewrote the script with a completely different approach taking advantage of my new knowledge of arrays that cut down on some of the later processing that would need to take place.

This experimentation that happened with that project helped me with my next big project which involved scanning photos and renaming them for a photo website.
