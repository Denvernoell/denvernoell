I started a new job in 2020. Little did I know that this would spend me spyrolling into learning many programming languages.

During the interview, questions about my experience with Excel came up. During my first week, one of my coworkers asked a question about a project that I had talked about in my interview. He proceeded to tell me that they sometimes used macros using VBA to do some of their work. This is the first time I had heard of VBA and throught the following weeks I started reading a book about the basics of VBA and started using it in my day-to-day work.

A few weeks later I was having a conversation with the same coworker who was telling be about a project a few years back that had some major hurdles because of the sheer amount of data. He described the problems that he was having and explained that he ended up learning SQL because it was able to be used with the large amount of data. I thought it was crazy that he learned a programming language for one project. Little did I know that over the course of the next few months I myself would learn a few languages. Now I am willing to learn a language to accomplish one task.

I was given a project of scanning and naming photos with the end goal being to publish them for the world to see. This process involved me diving deep into VBA to learn how to automate the naming and organizing process of the project. After the photos were scanned, I learned Powershell scripting to rearrange the photos based on a Regular Expression pattern and place them in the decades that they were originally taken in. From there I learned the basics of HTML and CSS in order to create the website. Once I created the website then I learned about web hosting and how to deploy it to a remote server which involved me learning SSH as well as other shell functions.

From there I thought it would be a good Idea to learn Python as I saw its uses for school. In school I took a MatLab course where I used what I had learned in VBA and Python to help with the basic conventions and structures of the language.

I also learned how to use AutoHotKey which is a programming language to automate tasks in Windows such as creating custom shortcuts for processes that can range in complexity from typing today's date in a certain format to opening a set of programs and much more.
