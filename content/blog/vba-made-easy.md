I started a new job in 2020. Little did I know that this would spend me spiraling into learning many programming languages.

On my first day one of my co-workers asked me what extent my Excel knowledge was. I told him some of the projects that I had worked on before and he said that it was a good starting point better than some interns in the past. He followed that up by saying that they did some macros but nothing crazy. This was my first time hearing about macros and a few days later another co-worker explained to me what they were and what they could do and a few weeks later I was introduced to a project that had a lengthy macro to put the data from many workbooks and combine their data on a single workbook. By this point I had done some research into macros and editing them in the VBA editor. I made a comment about how hard it must have been and how long a process it would have been to create the macro that I had in front of me. 

After some time with this project, there were problems that arose and I ended up learning much about VBA by creating scripts to aid with the long updating process every month. There was one change that came in the data we received that made the old script almost useless and I rewrote the script with a completely different approach taking advantage of my new knowledge of arrays that cut down on some of the later processing that would need to take place.

During the interview, questions about my experience with Excel came up. During my first week, one of my coworkers asked a question about a project that I had talked about in my interview. He proceeded to tell me that they sometimes used macros using VBA to do some of their work. This is the first time I had heard of VBA and throught the following weeks I started reading a book about the basics of VBA and started using it in my day-to-day work.

A few weeks later I was having a conversation with the same coworker who was telling be about a project a few years back that had some major hurdles because of the sheer amount of data. He described the problems that he was having and explained that he ended up learning SQL because it was able to be used with the large amount of data. I thought it was crazy that he learned a programming language for one project. Little did I know that over the course of the next few months I myself would learn a few languages. Now I am willing to learn a language to accomplish one task.

I was given a project of scanning and naming photos with the end goal being to publish them for the world to see. This process involved me diving deep into VBA to learn how to automate the naming and organizing process of the project. After the photos were scanned, I learned Powershell scripting to rearrange the photos based on a Regular Expression pattern and place them in the decades that they were originally taken in. From there I learned the basics of HTML and CSS in order to create the website. Once I created the website then I learned about web hosting and how to deploy it to a remote server which involved me learning SSH as well as other shell functions.

From there I thought it would be a good Idea to learn Python as I saw its uses for school. In school I took a MatLab course where I used what I had learned in VBA and Python to help with the basic conventions and structures of the language.

I also learned how to use AutoHotKey which is a programming language to automate tasks in Windows such as creating custom shortcuts for processes that can range in complexity from typing today's date in a certain format to opening a set of programs and much more.

This experimentation that happened with that project helped me with my next big project which involved scanning photos and renaming them for a photo website.
