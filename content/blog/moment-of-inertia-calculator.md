In my Design of Steel Structures course, in order to calculate needed values for beams. The Moment of Inertia, Centroid, and related properties need to be calculated. Shapes included in the AISC Steel Manual have these values calculated but if there is a member not included in the manual or if it is a built up member, then it needs to be calculated by hand
