I don’t think that many people would have guessed the amount of changes that would happen in 2020. There have been many hardships and unexpected difficulties such as job losses and businesses having to close. This has also been a time for reconnecting with loved ones and having extra time to work on projects and new interests. Personally, a positive impact was that this has given me more time to spend with my family that I wouldn’t have had. It forced me to slow down and focus on things to do together like cooking and watching educational videos. On the negative side, the challenge of adapting to online school and the cost of having to give up my apartment and move back home due to school being shut down.

Another challenge was to find new ways to study remotely with my peers. After working out the kinks, we found that this was a much more efficient way to collaborate and share our progress and ideas. Before we went to virtual learning, study groups required checking schedules, picking a location, people having to come late or leave early or not be able to come at all due to other commitments. With everyone becoming familiar with video chat and screen sharing capabilities, this allowed for us to study without actually being together with much more ease and efficiency. Going forward, even after this pandemic, I feel that study groups have a lot to learn from this experience and can cut down on wasted time such as preparation and travel time.

In January of 2020, I started a new internship. Little did I know that the year was going to take an unexpected turn. I was asked to learn new programs that had their own languages. The stay at home order allowed for more time to research and practice these topics which inspired me to learn more and more. I had more time to devote to reading as well as learning these and other new skills. Meetings were being held virtually just like my study groups. I can see how keeping meetings virtual in the future could be beneficial. Meetings could be recorded and played back for those that were unavailable.

I believe that the time I have spent with programming languages in 2020 has opened my eyes to what can be accomplished through scripting and the benefits of reading and understanding documentation. Going forward, when I encounter a problem and develop a solution, I will look back at this unprecedented time and realize among the adversities, there were many benefits that will have forever shaped my future.

One of the things that it allowed me to do was to devote time to reading as well as learning new skills. It reduced lost time while traveling and allowed for things that were not there before.

During the interview, questions about my experience with Excel came up. During my first week, one of my coworkers asked a question about a project that I had talked about in my interview. He proceeded to tell me that they sometimes used macros using VBA to do some of their work. This is the first time I had heard of VBA and throught the following weeks I started reading a book about the basics of VBA and started using it in my day-to-day work.

A few weeks later I was having a conversation with the same coworker who was telling be about a project a few years back that had some major hurdles because of the sheer amount of data. He described the problems that he was having and explained that he ended up learning SQL because it was able to be used with the large amount of data. I thought it was crazy that he learned a programming language for one project. Little did I know that over the course of the next few months I myself would learn a few languages. Now I am willing to learn a language to accomplish one task.

I was given a project of scanning and naming photos with the end goal being to publish them for the world to see. This process involved me diving deep into VBA to learn how to automate the naming and organizing process of the project. After the photos were scanned, I learned Powershell scripting to rearrange the photos based on a Regular Expression pattern and place them in the decades that they were originally taken in. From there I learned the basics of HTML and CSS in order to create the website. Once I created the website then I learned about web hosting and how to deploy it to a remote server which involved me learning SSH as well as other shell functions.

From there I thought it would be a good Idea to learn Python as I saw its uses for school. In school I took a MatLab course where I used what I had learned in VBA and Python to help with the basic conventions and structures of the language.

I also learned how to use AutoHotKey which is a programming language to automate tasks in Windows such as creating custom shortcuts for processes that can range in complexity from typing today's date in a certain format to opening a set of programs and much more.
