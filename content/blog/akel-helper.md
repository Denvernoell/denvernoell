# Getting Started

Akel Helper is written in python and uses xlwings to interact with excel. Because Akel Helper has a specific set of modules that need to be installed, the easiest way to work with it is to have Anaconda installed. This will allow for the app to run on a python installation that has the required modules.

If Anaconda is installed, running **Akel Helper.bat** will start the app. This will start in your default browser.
