## HTML

I watched a video about how to host a website for free with Github Pages. They showed that html5up.net had many templates that could be used and edited for free that actually look really cool. Going to the site I downloaded a couple of the templates and started looking at the HTML. Fun fact, I didn't know HTML at the time. So I watched a crash course to teach me the basics of what different elements were used for and how they affected the website.

## CSS

Next was CSS. I also didn't know anything about CSS. Learning about CSS was interesting because it can be daunting if you don't know exactly what you want it to look like.

## JavaScript

After that came JavaScript. Took a look at the code for that portion. Still have no Idea what is going on with that.

## Github

Uploading it to a Github Repo did not take much effort although the process is still fairly new to me.

This worked for my personal site but when it came to hosting photos for the photo site, file sizes became and issue and I had to look for something that could host large files and files in large quantities

## Domain name

Epik

I personally used Epik because it was recommended by Luke Smith. This process was fairly simple and did not take a whole lot of effort.
DNS records:
How to point to different sites

## VPS hosting

Digital Ocean
This part might be the weirdest and most complex part of the whole experience. What a VPS basically does is gives you a server that you have access to that you can upload files to and host your website from them

This consisted of:

- Learning how to remote in to a server
- Sending files from your current computer to a remote server
- Pointing a custom domain to the hosted server site
