I don't think that many people went into 2020 expecting there to be a nationwide quarentine for most of the year, or even thinking that it would extend into 2021. I think that for most people, it derailed what was normal and replaced it with situations that we never thought we would be in.

One thing that was hard for me for a while was getting in a consistant workout routine. Starting with a white board and expanding it to creating a checklist system using Notion has created a routine that has motivated me to consistintly meet my daily goals.

Before each week I descided the exercises and reps that I would complete 5 sets of. The first few weeks I did 10 push ups until I felt comfortable enough to encorperated pull ups. The first day of that week I did 5 sets of 5 pull ups and the next day I was very sore. I proceeded to do 1 set of 5 for the rest of the week and progressively worked up to 5 sets over the following weeks.

As the weeks have gone on, I increased to 15 push ups, 8 pull ups until that was comfortable, followed by 20 push ups and 10 pull ups. Now I am doing 25 push ups and 12 pull ups. This may or may not seem impressive, but compared to where I was a few weeks ago, I credit the improvement to consistancy and the motivation that seeing the whiteboard with all of the reps that I have completed up to that point showing what I have put in has pushed me forward to improve even when I am busy.
