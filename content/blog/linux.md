When Covid hit my city pretty hard, my company descided to switch to remote work in order to mitigate risk. In our office, employees have dual-monitor set ups. To anyone who has never had a dual or tri-monitor set up, try it, you'll like it. Because of this, our boss reccommended getting a second monitor if we did not already have one so that we could mimic our office set up as well as possible. This caused me to scour the internet to find a monitor that was cheap but also fit my needs.

What I found is that used monitors weren't much cheaper than getting a used computer with a monitor. I found a computer with a 24'' monitor with a small desktop. I went with that option and soon found out that the monitor wasn't super great when it came to quality when using the VGA cable.
Then when it came to reimbursement I did not get a reciept because the seller would not give one.

I watched a video about Linux and he showed how to download Ubuntu. The phrasing that the video used was _You can dual-boot if you want but I wouldn't recommend it and don't know why you would want to_. So I went all in and erased the Windows 10 from the device and quickly found out that the wifi that was working on Windows, was not working on Ubuntu. After watching 4 different videos showing how to use terminal commands to get access to wifi, I was not successful. This was some of my first usage with the command line.

Then I watched a video talking about how Linux Mint is the perfect distro to start with. So I switched over to Linux mint and after being unsuccessful with the Wifi on there I figured out how to use the Ethernet cord from my primary desktop to my _Linux desktop_, since there were no Ethernet connections where I had my computers. I figured out some cool stuff with linux mint and within a few days ended up on Manjaro. Manjaro was cool and all but I watched a video about how to change the startup screen and the poster said that they were using _Awesome_ because it looked cool and they changed it to _Awesome_, so I changed it to _Awesome_. Then they rebooted their computer and I rebooted my computer. When my computer rebooted, I found that I had made a mistake and was not able to log back in. Come to find out, I was using _xfce_ and not _Awesome_. This is something that I did not understand at the time.

Then I tried out POP! OS. I really liked the look and feel of POP!OS. The keyboard shortcuts were also pretty nifty. They had just come out with a window tiling feature and it exposed me to how that works. This feature also introduced me to having multiple desktops instead of just having everything open on one desktop. After some time I realized that most of the look and feel actually was from Gnome and not POP. I switched back to Manjaro but this time I used the Gnome edition.
